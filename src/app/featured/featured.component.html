    <p class="text-justify pt-8">
      I am a full-stack software developer with over two years of experience in
      the legal tech space, building scalable applications and automation
      solutions. With a background in structural engineering and six years of
      experience in the field, I bring a strong problem-solving mindset to
      software development. My transition into tech was driven by a passion for
      creating efficient, data-driven solutions, and I continue to leverage my
      analytical skills to develop tools that enhance workflows and optimize
      processes. I thrive on tackling complex challenges through code and enjoy
      the continuous learning that comes with software development. Outside of
      work, I love participating in team sports, staying active, and traveling
      the world.
