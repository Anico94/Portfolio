  <h2 id="about" class="text-[22px] font-bold pt-4">About Me</h2>
  <p class="text-base pt-1 text-justify">
    I’m a full-stack software developer with 3 years of experience in the legal
    tech space, building and supporting scalable applications, APIs, and
    automation solutions used in production environments. I enjoy working across
    the stack and taking ownership of features from design through to delivery.
  </p>
  <p class="text-base pt-1 text-justify">
    Before transitioning into software development, I spent 7 years working as a
    structural engineer. That experience shaped how I approach software today —
    with a strong emphasis on problem-solving, reliability, and clear,
    maintainable solutions.
  </p>
  <p class="text-base pt-1 text-justify">
    My move into tech was driven by a desire to work closer to the systems that
    power modern products and to build efficient, data-driven tools that improve
    existing workflows. I particularly enjoy modernising platforms,
    collaborating across teams, and continuously learning as technologies
    evolve.
  </p>
  <p class="text-base pt-1 text-justify">
    I care about maintainable code, thoughtful design decisions, and solving
    problems in a way that balances quality with practicality.
  </p>
  <p class="text-base pt-1 text-justify">
    Outside of work, I enjoy team sports, staying active, travelling, and
    cooking simple, tasty dishes — all of which help keep me balanced and
    curious both professionally and personally.
